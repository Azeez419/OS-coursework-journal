WEEK 4: JOURNAL 	PHASE 4: Initial System Configuration & Security
Task: System configuration and security setup using SSH
Machines Used: Linux Mint (workstation) and Ubuntu (server)

1. SSH Key-Based Authentication
For this part, I used Linux Mint to connect to my Ubuntu server.
I created an SSH key on Linux Mint and copied it to Ubuntu using:

ssh-copy-id abdulazeez@192.168.56.101

After that, I tested the connection and it logged me in without asking for a password, which shows the key-based authentication is working.
 

2. Firewall Configuration (Only allow Mint to connect)
On Ubuntu, I enabled the firewall (UFW) and set it so only my Mint machine (192.168.56.102) can connect through SSH.  
Commands used:

sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.56.102 to any port 22
sudo ufw deny 22
sudo ufw status verbose
 

3. sshd_config Before and After Change
I opened the SSH config file using:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

My file didn’t have “PasswordAuthentication yes”, so I added:
PasswordAuthentication no
Then restarted SSH:
sudo systemctl restart ssh

  
4. Creating a Non-Root Admin User
I created a new admin user called adminuser:

sudo adduser adminuser
sudo usermod -aG sudo adminuser

Then switched to the account and tested sudo:

su - adminuser
sudo apt update

 
5. Remote Administration Through SSH
All my changes on Ubuntu were done from Linux Mint using SSH.

Commands like:
sudo apt update
uname -a

prove the remote management is working.

6. Firewall Rules Documentation (Numbered)
I used:

sudo ufw status numbered

This shows the exact firewall rule order.

Conclusion
In Week 4, I configured secure access to my server. I set up SSH keys, updated the SSH configuration, created an admin user, and restricted the firewall to only my workstation. Everything was done through SSH with screenshots as evidence.
