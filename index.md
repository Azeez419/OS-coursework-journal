# Operating Systems Coursework Journal

This repository contains my weekly Operating Systems coursework for my
BSc Software Engineering degree at the University of Roehampton.

The work documents what I completed each week during the lab sessions.
It includes the commands I ran, screenshots as evidence, explanations of the tasks,
and short reflections on what I learned throughout the module.
