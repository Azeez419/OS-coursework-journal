Week 1 Journal – System Planning & Distribution Selection
Module: Operating Systems
Assessment: Week 1 – Phase 1: System Planning and Distribution Selection

1.	System Architecture Diagram

 
Notes:
I used my laptop as the host and set up two virtual machines inside VirtualBox. One is the Ubuntu Server, and the other is Linux Mint. I added both NAT (so they can use the internet) and Host-Only (so they can connect to each other). Each one got its own IP address 192.168.56.101 for Ubuntu and 192.168.56.102 for Mint. I tested both with ping and they worked fine.

2.	Distribution Selection Justification
Chosen Server Distro: Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS
Alternatives Considered: Debian 12, Rocky Linux 9
Comparison:
•	Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS: Beginner-friendly, lots of documentation, frequent updates, easy networking setup.
•	Debian 12: Very stable but older packages.
•	Rocky Linux 9: Enterprise-grade stability but fewer desktop support tools.
Decision:
I chose Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS because it’s stable, modern, and supported by a large community. It works well on my laptop, has simple commands, and fits the learning goals of the Operating Systems module.

3.	Workstation Configuration Decision
Chosen Workstation: Linux Mint 22.2 “Zara” (Cinnamon)
Reasons:
•	User-friendly interface and very similar to Ubuntu (same base).
•	Easier to take screenshots and access files.
•	Perfect for practicing both GUI and terminal commands.
•	Stable and lightweight enough to run smoothly in VirtualBox.

4.	Network Configuration
VirtualBox Settings:
•	Adapter 1: NAT (Internet)
•	Adapter 2: Host-Only Adapter → VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter (192.168.56.1)
IP Addresses:
•	The Ubuntu Server is configured with a Host-Only adapter and assigned the IP address 192.168.56.101. It serves as the main server in the setup.
•	The Linux Mint virtual machine also uses a Host-Only adapter, with the IP address 192.168.56.102, functioning as a workstation.

Connectivity Tests:
From Server → Workstation:  ping 192.168.56.102  
From Workstation → Server:  ping 192.168.56.101
